# Minecraft Server Creator
This is a small script that makes it easy to create a new Minecraft Server. 
Just run the script and specify which version of Minecraft you want to make a server for or download the latest version. 
This can be done by specifying a command line argument or by running the script and following the instructions.
This script then will download a Minecraft server JAR file and set it up with minimal input.

## Prerequisites:
1. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be installed. The minimum version is at least Java 1.8.
2. Python 3.6 if you want to use the Python script instead of the executable. (Optional)

## Steps for Python Script:
1. Download the script
2. Download all of the dependencies
3. Move the script to the directory you want and run it
4. Follow the instructions  
The server should be running now.

## Steps for Executable:
1. Download the latest release
2. Move the script to the directory you want and run it
3. Follow the instructions  
The server should be running now.

## Examples:
``` ./create_server 1.16.4 ```  
``` ./create_server release ```  
``` ./create_server snapshot ```  
``` ./create_server view ```
